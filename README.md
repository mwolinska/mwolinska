## Profile

I'm a Materials Engineer from [Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk) and 
I previously worked as a consultant in Financial Services (ex-[EY](https://www.ey.com/en_gl)). 

I'm starting my journey into the world of AI by upskilling in computer science, currently learning python. I will be joining the class of 2023 at Imperial College to complete an MSc in Artificial Intelligence starting October 2022.
